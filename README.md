## Purpose

This library is Python implementation of toolkit for dictionary based named entity recognition. It is intended to store any thesaurus in a trie-like structure and identify any of stored synonyms in a string.

## Installation and dependencies

```bash
pip install pilsner
```

`pilsner` is tested in Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

The only dependency is `sic` package. While it can be automatically installed at the time of `pilsner` installation, manual installation of `sic` beforehand might also be considered (see benchmark of cythonized vs pure Python implementation in `sic` docimentation, [https://pypi.org/project/sic/](https://pypi.org/project/sic/)).
